fontSize: Responsive.fontSize(context, mobile: 14, tablet: 16, desktop: 18)

// Padding that scales with screen size
padding: Responsive.padding(
  context,
  mobile: EdgeInsets.all(16),
  tablet: EdgeInsets.all(20),
  desktop: EdgeInsets.all(24),
)

// Icon size adaptation
size: Responsive.iconSize(context, mobile: 20, tablet: 24, desktop: 28)
```

### Responsive Layout
```dart
ResponsiveLayout(
  maxWidth: 1200,           // Max width for desktop
  centerContent: true,      // Center on larger screens
  child: Column(
    children: [
      // Your content here
    ],
  ),
)
```

### Responsive Grid
```dart
ResponsiveGrid(
  mobileColumns: 1,         // 1 column on mobile

  children: [
    // Your grid items
  ],
)
```

## Screen Size Breakpoints

## Usage in Existing Screens

The responsive system has been applied to:
- **Home Screen**: Responsive app bar, tab navigation, and icon sizing
- **Manage Free Gifts Screen**: Adaptive form layouts and grid displays
